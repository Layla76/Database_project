<br /><br />
The ERD shows all entities and relations related to billing.  <br /><br />


CASH FLOW

Tables (tables that list incoming or outgoing funds): <br />
ID - PK <br />
Name - name of table (grants, payments, procurements, insured, subscribed, member penalties) <br />
Flow direction - incoming - 1 or outgoing - -1 <br />

Cash flow: <br />
ID - PK <br />
Table ID - FK from tables table <br />

** All tables in tables.name will have non overlapping foreign keys from cash_flow.ID

-----

LIBRARY ASSETS  <br />

Assets: <br />
ID - PK <br />
Type -  books, rooms, or buildings <br />

Books:  <br />
Asset ID - PK, FK from asset table  <br />
Price - price of the book  <br />

Rooms:  <br />
Asset ID - PK, FK from asset table  <br />
Price - price of the room  <br />

Buildings: <br />
Asset ID - PK, FK from asset table <br />
Price - price of the building <br />

** Books, rooms, and buildings will have no overlapping keys with each other. This is acheived by first creating a new asset row, and then using its ID to create a new book/room/building row.

Suppliers (sources to buy assets for the library): <br />
ID - PK <br />

Procurements -- between assets and suppliers: <br />
Cash flow ID - PK, FK from cash flow table <br />
Date - date of procurement <br />
Status - have funds been transferred yet? 0 - no, 1 - yes <br />
** The cost is based on the corresponding cost of the assetâ€™s type ID <br />

Providers (insurance providers): <br />
ID - PK <br />

Insurance (insurance plans): <br />
ID - PK <br />
Cost - cost of insurance plan <br />
Provider ID - FK from providers table <br />

Insured -- between assets and insurance: <br />
Cash flow ID - PK, FK from cash flow table <br />
Start date - start date of plan <br />
End date - end date of plan <br />
Status - have funds been transferred yet? 0 - no, 1 - yes <br />

-----

EMPLOYEE SALARIES

Jobs: <br />
ID - PK <br />

Wages: <br />
ID - PK <br />
Job ID - FK from jobs table <br />
Wage - the set monthly wage <br />

People (all people in the database): <br />

Penalties (fines for members): <br />
ID - PK <br />
Type - late book, lost book, damaged book <br />
Fee - cost of fine <br />

Member penalties -- between members and penalties: <br />
Cash flow ID - PK, FK from cash flow table <br />
Issue date - date given <br />
Due date - date payment is due <br />
Status - have funds been transferred yet? 0 - no, 1 - yes <br />

[Views and select queries](Views.sql)<br />

Generating total prices for books, rooms, and buildings<br /><br />

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c31d453-e3f5-4b45-8681-108073c9eef6)<br /><br /><br />
The reason that the totals for books and rooms seems to be zero in the graph is that proportionally, the total spend on buildings is much greater (data generation was random, but given contraints so that books prices < room prices < building prices). The first line on the y axis is already 20,000,000,000, which is 2 and 4 order of magnitudes greater than the rooms and books total, respectively.

[Functions](Functions.sql)<br />

Function #4 combines three select queries for the prices of books, rooms, and buildings. The parameter is the asset type (book/room/building) and instead of one of the inner joins being either the book, room, or building table, it unions the tables so that the asset id will match a row in the new table.
<br /><br />

[Triggers](Triggers.sql)<br /><br />

The two triggers make sure that [1] asset ids across books, rooms, and buildings are all unique and [2] cash flow ids across grants + all relation tables are unique. The trigger calls the function with a parameter specifying the relevant table, and the function inserts a new asset/cash flow and inserts the same id* to the new row that called the trigger. The id is retrieved by selecting the first id that appears in a table of descending ids. The passed argument can only be referenced through the variable TG_ARGV[0].<br /><br />

The id is determined by a sequence that increases by 1 for each insertion.** <br />

CREATE SEQUENCE asset_id_seq;<br />
CREATE SEQUENCE cf_id_seq;<br />

Altering the tables to have the default primary key go by the sequence<br />
ALTER TABLE assets<br />
ALTER COLUMN id_ SET DEFAULT nextval('asset_id_seq');<br /><br />

ALTER TABLE cash_flow<br />
ALTER COLUMN id_ SET DEFAULT nextval('cf_id_seq');<br /><br />

I found the max ids for each table and set the sequences to the max + 1<br />

SELECT setval('asset_id_seq', 999990001, false);<br />
SELECT setval('cf_id_seq', 999999001, false);<br /><br />
